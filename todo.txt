Primary:
Currently this rendering is all done in main. Abstract this to
a text renderer (?).

Look into font-kit instead of writing my own complete font rasterizer.

Render Grid:
A grid is to be used to render text at the beginning because
handling mono-space fonts are simpiler and have less things to worry
about when placing the characters on the screen. 
For Mono-space, each character will only need to be formatted within its
grid cell, not the entire line.
