Primary:
Make sure the panes are rendered properly onto the screen.
They are currently being rendered incorrectly. It seems the
panes framebuffer is larger then the actual screen (validate).


Next:
Look into font-kit instead of writing my own complete font rasterizer.

Open Questions:
Where should the text color be stored?
How should the rendering handle higher screen resolutions: dpi_factor >
1?
Re-evaluate how inputs are being handled.
Refactor pane module
Refactor editor module
Expand editor-core module


Done:
Basic TTF rasterizing
Basic floating text rendering
Basic grid text rendering
Window abstraction
Basic text input, cannot delete yet.
Cached pane rendering.

Render Grid:
A grid is to be used to render text at the beginning because
handling mono-space fonts are simpiler and have less things to worry
about when placing the characters on the screen.
For Mono-space, each character will only need to be formatted within its
grid cell, not the entire line.

I have decided to do traditional text rendering.


Vsync delays the event loop process from closing in all platforms.
A solution to this is to render in a different thread than the event loop.
This is intented in the future.
