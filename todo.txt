Edit Engine:

Next:
Define and explain the concepts above (Render Grid, Edit Pane, Edit

Open Questions:
Where should the text color be stored?

Done:
Basic TTF rasterizing
Basic floating text rendering
Basic grid text rendering
Window abstraction

Render Grid:
A grid is to be used to render text at the beginning because
handling mono-space fonts are simpiler and have less things to worry
about when placing the characters on the screen.
For Mono-space, each character will only need to be formatted within its
grid cell, not the entire line.

I have decided to do traditional text rendering.
