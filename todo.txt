Primary:

Look into font-kit instead of writing my own complete font rasterizer.

Edit Pane:


Edit Engine:

Next:
Define and explain the concepts above (Render Grid, Edit Pane, Edit
Engine).
Abstract the application concept.
GlyphCache
Pane

Open Questions:
Where should the text color be stored?
How should the rendering handle higher screen resolutions: dpi_factor >
1?

Vsync delays the event loop process from closing in all platforms.
A solution to this is to render in a different thread than the event loop.
This is intented in the future.

Done:
Basic TTF rasterizing
Basic floating text rendering
Basic grid text rendering
Window abstraction

Render Grid:
A grid is to be used to render text at the beginning because
handling mono-space fonts are simpiler and have less things to worry
about when placing the characters on the screen.
For Mono-space, each character will only need to be formatted within its
grid cell, not the entire line.

I have decided to do traditional text rendering.
