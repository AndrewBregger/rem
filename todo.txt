Primary:
Basic text layout on a line. The characters should be formatted
correctly. (Maybe the render grid should be started for this.)

Adapt to multi line string to be rendered correctly.


Render Grid:
A grid is to be used to render text at the beginning because
handling mono-space fonts are simpiler and have less things to worry
about when placing the characters on the screen. 
For Mono-space, each character will only need to be formatted within its
grid cell, not the entire line.
