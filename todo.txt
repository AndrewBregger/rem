Primary:
Expand the functionality of the front end (new line, tabs, backspace,
etc)

Make sure the panes are rendered properly onto the screen.

How to handle document indexing when the cursor coordinates are not the
same as where it would be in the document. This would happen when a tab
is inserted that isn't replaced by spaces but the cursor is still offset
by multiple character space. If it is left one to one, then there could
be a document insertion out of bounds.
    - The conversion function that takes the cursor coordinates and view
      offsets and computes the document index could take that offset
      into consideration. IE. if a tab is seen, then count that as two
      characters instead of 1.


Next:
Look into font-kit instead of writing my own complete font rasterizer.

Open Questions:
Where should the text color be stored?


How should the rendering handle higher screen resolutions: dpi_factor >
1?
Re-evaluate how inputs are being handled.
Refactor pane module
Refactor editor module
Expand editor-core module


Done:
Basic TTF rasterizing
Basic floating text rendering
Basic grid text rendering
Window abstraction
Basic text input, cannot delete yet.
Cached pane rendering.

They are currently being rendered incorrectly. It seems the
panes framebuffer is larger then the actual screen (validate).
This has been corrected by using only physical sizes for the pane sizes
when rendering instead of recomputing from the cells and cell size.



Vsync delays the event loop process from closing in all platforms.
A solution to this is to render in a different thread than the event loop.
This is intented in the future.
